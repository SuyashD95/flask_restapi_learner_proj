# flask_restapi_learner_proj
Demo projects that I have created to learn about developing REST APIs using Flask_RESTful and Flask-SQLAlchemy frameworks.

## Attribution
I have used [Tech with Tim](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg)'s channel video on developing REST APIs titled **[ Python REST API Tutorial - Building a Flask REST API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMppyAPbLYk)**.

Apart from this, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the developers responsible for developing and maintaining the **[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), [Flask-RESTful](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/)** frameworks.
