# flask_restapi_learner_proj
Demo projects that I have created to learn about developing REST APIs using Flask_RESTful and Flask-SQLAlchemy frameworks.

## About Demo Projects

### 1. Hello World API
It is a very simple app intended to teach people the very basics of developing REST APIs using the Flask-RESTful framework.

### 2. Video Hosting Site API
It is an intermediate and more comprehensive app which utilizes a lot of features of the Flask-RESTful framework which are commonly used in real-world API development like Argument Parsing, Input Validation, Handling Bad/Invalid Requests as well as communicating with a data persistence layer, a SQLite3 database, with the help of Flask-SQLAlchemy.

## Attribution
I have used **[Tech with Tim](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg)'s** channel video on developing REST APIs titled **[ Python REST API Tutorial - Building a Flask REST API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMppyAPbLYk)**.

Apart from this, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the developers responsible for developing and maintaining the **[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), [Flask-RESTful](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** and **[Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/)** frameworks.
